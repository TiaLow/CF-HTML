# Learning CSS

## **Instructions:** we are told to share to a non-technical person a summary of what we learned in the readings and then create a new page in our git hub with our notes.

We learned about CSS: Cascade Style Sheets. They are so names because they go from least to most specificity in order to apply the styling depending on the selectors.

-    Selectors

A selector is anything that is used by CSS to specify how the elements will render and present on the web page. A selector can be the name of the tag, a class, an ID, or a grouping of elements.


##  There are three types of applying styling to a site:

-  There is external styling: we use a link to another document to separate the html to the styles. This is the prefered way to style.

-  There is internal styling: styles are defined in the same document as the HTML. This is usually on the head.

-  There is inline styling: styles are applied to elements especificially.   

Why stling comes down to either the product owner, or the web designer, we have to apply Jon Duckett's principles of design outlined in both our textbooks. We might not be designing ourselves when working on a website, but we can use best practices to 
ensure our code is easy to read to other developers and easily maintainable when it comes to styling.

## Summary

Styling is best when separated in to its own document, because we can shitch out a styling sheet and dramatically and atumatically change the presentation of a web page instead of haveing to manually hange the styling in each element when it is mixed with the HTML. Styling is what makes the box-modeled HTML elements display and translate the UI vision, and by using selector we can specify and re-utilize code and save time.
